After months of hard work, I am proud to announce the grand opening of my new online store!

I have been an electronics hardware enthusiast for my whole life. To be honest, I've always been more interested in spending time with machines than with people. As a kid, I enjoyed walking the alleys of my local neighborhood and collecting the discarded electronics that people threw away. I would take them home and study them in my room, trying to understand how they worked. I would discard the broken components and keep the good ones. Then I'd put the pieces together in a new way. I was particularly fascinated by things with internal radios, but I got distracted by the rise of personal computers before discovering the world of amateur radio.

When I discovered amateur radio, I was hooked. It felt like I'd finally found the home I'd been searching for all my life. It's unfortunate that it took me five decades to find it, but I'm still young (at heart) and full of curiosity, so there's plenty of time left to enjoy it.

I've made my career in the software industry, but I got the most enjoyment from it when I was sharing the cool new tech with other tech geeks. As such, I've spent much of my time in software by building documentation and training for engineers. It's that experience that I hope will set me apart in this microchasm of the tech industry that we call ham radio. Let's face it, most of the DIY hardware that's accessible to the general ham is stuff that's been around for 40 years. I may not be able to bring you a completely new design, but I can put a new spin on it (if it needs one). Regardless, and more importantly, I can provide documentation that anyone can understand, and I can present it to you in a way that will help you understand why certain implementation decisions were made. I hope that the time you spend building my kits inspires, and enables, you to make your own custom improvements. If you are inspired to improve something, please share it with me. I'd love to hear about your creations. Maybe we can inspire each other.

In the meantime, keep an eye out here for new product updates, and keep in touch.
