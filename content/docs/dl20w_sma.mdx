        Find a clean, well-lit area to work. Collect your kit components and tools. You will need the following:
        * Soldering iron 
        * Flux-core solder, or solder and solder paste
        * Small wire cutters
        * Needle-nose pliers (optional)
        * Multimeter for testing (optional)
        * Helping hands, or similar device, to hold components while soldering

All the resistors are identical, so they can go in any of the marked spaces; orientation isn't important since the resistors are not polarized. If you're experienced with electronics, you can install all the resistors on your own now. If you're new to soldering, follow along with my instructions.`}>

                Insert the first four resistors into the PCB at the location marked R1-R4. The resistors can go in either way; there is no polarity to worry about. Once installed, bend the leads outward slightly to hold the resistors in place. The resistors should be flush with the PCB and on the printed side of the board.

                            There is a balancing act in play here. By placing the resistors flush with the PCB, we're limiting the air flowing around them, which limits the amount of heat/power they're able to passively dissipate.
                            However, by keeping the resistor leads short, we're reducing the parasitic inductance in the circuit, thereby lowering the SWR of the device at higher frequencies and increasing its efficiency. This is a trade-off that I made based on my personal preferences; you are welcome to make other choices.
