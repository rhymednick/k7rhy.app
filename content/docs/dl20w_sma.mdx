        Find a clean, well-lit area to work. Collect your kit components and tools. You will need the following:
        * Soldering iron 
        * Flux-core solder, or solder and solder paste
        * Small wire cutters
        * Needle-nose pliers (optional)
        * Multimeter for testing (optional)
        * Helping hands, or similar device, to hold components while soldering

    <ProcStep text="Prepare and install the resistors" >
        <Desc>
        Install the resistors on the PCB at the locations marked R1-R8. All the resistors are identical, so they can go in any of the marked spaces; orientation isn't important since the resistors are not polarized. If you're experienced with electronics, you can install all the resistors on your own now. If you're new to soldering, follow along with my instructions.

            <Desc>
            Bend the leads of the resistor so that they are at a 90-degree angle to the 
            body of the resistor. This will make it easier to install the resistor on 
            the PCB. Use the PCB as a guide to determine the correct lead spacing.

                Insert the first four resistors into the PCB at the location marked R1-R4. The resistors can go in either way; there is no polarity to worry about. Once installed, bend the leads outward slightly to hold the resistors in place. The resistors should be flush with the PCB and on the printed side of the board.

                    There is a balancing act in play here. By placing the resistors flush with the PCB, we're limiting the air flowing around them, which limits the amount of heat/power they're able to passively dissipate.

                    However, by keeping the resistor leads short, we're reducing the parasitic inductance in the circuit, thereby lowering the SWR of the device at higher frequencies and increasing its efficiency. This is a trade-off that I made based on my personal preferences; you are welcome to make other choices.

            <Desc>
            Hold the soldering iron to the pad and the lead of the resistor on the back of the PCB. Touch the solder to the joint, not the iron. The solder will flow onto the pad and the lead. Remove the solder first, then the iron. The joint should be shiny and smooth. Repeat this process for all the resistors.

                <Desc>
                    Insert the capacitor into the PCB at the location marked C1. The capacitor is not polarized, so it may be installed in any orientation.

                <Desc>
                    Insert the diode into the PCB at the location marked D1. The diode has polarity, so it must be installed in the correct orientation. Match the black line on the diode with the white line on the PCB silkscreen. Position the diode with the black line closest to the edge of the board, facing away from the resistors.

        <Desc>
            The installation of the BNC connector is tricky because of the alignment of the leads. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a good connection.

                <Desc>
                    Bend the leads of the BNC connector back roughly 30 degrees. This will make it easier to install the connector on the PCB.

                <Desc>
                    Begin by inserting the leads of the BNC connector into the PCB at an angle, into the location marked J1. They are very short, so starting this way will make sure that everything is aligned correctly. Once aligned, press the connector down flat on the PCB. It will fit snugly.

                <Desc>
                    Soldering one of the mounting posts of the BNC connector before soldering the leads. Hold the soldering iron to the pad and the post of the BNC connector on the back of the PCB to heat it up, and apply solder. The posts are thick, so they will take a little longer to heat up. The posts are not connected to the circuit and are only for mechanical support. Once the posts are soldered, solder the connector leads. The leads will not need to be trimmed.

                <Desc>
                    Confirm that all the components are installed correctly and that no parts are missing. Aside from TP1 and TP2, there should be no marked areas of the board that do not have an attached component. There should be no empty holes on the board.

            <ProcStep text='Inspect solder joints' image='/images/dl20w_bnc/guide/check-solder.jpg'>
                <Desc>
                    Inspect all solder joints to ensure that they are shiny and smooth. If not shiny, apply your soldering iron to the joint to reflow the solder. There should be no solder bridges between adjacent pads, and no solder balls should be present on the PCB.

                <Desc>
                    Using a multimeter, measure the resistance between the two leads on the back of the BNC connector where it connects to the top of the PCB. The resistance should measure between 47.5 and 52.5 ohms. Slight deviations from that range are acceptable, but any major deviations may indicate a problem with the assembly or components.

                    Verify that the black line on the diode matches the white line on the PCB silkscreen. The diode should be oriented with the black line closest to the edge of the board facing away from the resistors, with the lead going through the hole labeled K.

                    A dummy load is a device used to simulate an electrical load (like an antenna). In amateur radio,
                    this allows you to safely test and calibrate equipment without broadcasting signals. This dummy load
                    is a resistor array designed to dissipate power without radiating radio frequency (RF) signals. It
                    is rated for 20 watts of power (continuous operation), but it can handle more for short periods.
                
                
                    To use the dummy load, connect it to your radio's antenna port using a BNC cable or BNC cable
                    adapter. The first time you use it, start with low power and verify that the dummy load is working
                    correctly. You will know it's working correctly because the SWR will stay under 1.5 for HF
                    frequencies.

                    The dummy load has components and test pads that allow you to measure the power being transmitted by
                    your radio. For more information, see **[Measuring Power](/docs/power_measurement)**.



                <DocSection title="Precautions">
                        Energy is dissipated as heat in the resistors. Therefore, the dummy load will get hot during
                        use. The more energy you put into it, the hotter it will get. Keep this in mind and do not touch
                        the dummy load while it is in use. Allow it to cool before handling it.


                        If mounting the dummy load in an enclosure, ensure that the enclosure is well-ventilated.
